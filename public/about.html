<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2><p>My name is Geraldine Fields but everyone calls me Geri.  I have a bachelor's degree in History and a master's in Digital Libraries.
  I have been dabbling in coding for a while but have not yet mastered it.  However, I am not giving up.  Once i am able to code there is a lot I have planned on doing with that skill.
